# Open Source Calculator

## Description

This calculator is dedicated to bit computation specific operations. Most two's
complement calculators in the current top google searches are hard to use and
have terrible interfaces. Moreover, they have a tons of ads on it, and the 
computation is never done on the client side. (Why does calculator need server 
computation????) It is painfully obvious that most calculators out there not 
only calculates what the user wants, but also collects a tons of user data. This
 calculator aims to break that and will be ads free and absolutely no RPC 
 required - which is how it should be. The user have control over the entire 
code base.
